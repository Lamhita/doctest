### Revised Version (Partner-Focused)

Subscription plans provide users with a range of service options, each configured with specific parameters.

Following our latest system update, user records have been enhanced with additional attributes, as detailed in our updated API documentation. These changes may require adjustments to customer support workflows and subscription management processes.

For example, when a user subscribes to a plan, their status is temporarily updated to `signing` pending subscription confirmation.

Providers can create an unlimited number of subscription plans, with each plan's availability governed by user type mappings. These plans can be customized to address specific business requirements.

Moreover, subscription plans are structured around standardized user attributes and enforced through role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure system security.

### Revised Version (User-Focused)

Discover a variety of subscription plans designed just for you–each plan comes with its own set of features.

Thanks to our latest system update, we've added some cool new details to your profile (check out our updated guide for more info!). You might notice a few changes in how we handle support and subscriptions–all for a smoother experience.

For example, once you subscribe to a plan, your status will change to `signing` while we finalize everything.

If you're a provider, you can create as many subscription plans as you need. Each plan is set up for specific user types, and you can easily tweak them to suit your business needs.

Plus, our subscription plans are built around familiar user profiles and protected by role-based access controls (RBAC) to keep things secure.

### Notes

| **Original** | **Edited (Partner-Focused)** | **Explanation (Grammar & Style Errors in Original)** | **Edited (User-Focused)** | **Explanation (User-Friendly Adjustments)** |
|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Plans provide product clients with a variety of service options defined within a preconfigured score. | **Subscription plans provide users with a range of service options, each configured with specific parameters.** | "Product clients" is unclear and unnatural; "users" is more appropriate. "Preconfigured score" is vague and confusing; "configured with specific parameters" makes the meaning clearer. | **Discover a variety of subscription plans designed just for you – each plan comes with its own set of features.** | Uses "discover" to engage the user. Simplifies technical phrasing into a friendlier, more inviting message. |
| Please note that shortly after the feature implementation, your customer service flow and solutions may undergo some alignment due to an extensive system update. | **Following our latest system update, user records have been enhanced with additional attributes, as detailed in our updated API documentation. These changes may require adjustments to customer support workflows and subscription management processes.** | "Please note" is unnecessary filler. "Feature implementation" is vague—clarified with "latest system update". "Undergo some alignment" is unnatural and imprecise—reworded to clearly state that customer workflows may need adjustments. | **Thanks to our latest system update, we've added some cool new details to your profile (check out our updated guide for more info!). You might notice a few changes in how we handle support and subscriptions – all for a smoother experience.** | Casual, engaging tone. Directly addresses the user with "we've added" and "you might notice" to make the update feel beneficial. |
| To be more precise, a user record is now supplemented by additional properties, which are described in the latest version of our API reference. | **(Merged into previous sentence for better flow)** | "To be more precise" is redundant here. "Supplemented by additional properties" is awkward—reworded for clarity. This sentence is unnecessary as a standalone and is better integrated into the previous one. | **(Merged into the previous user-facing sentence for better readability.)** | Removed redundancy and merged into a more natural, flowing explanation. |
| For example, the users can be transferred to the `idle` state before they confirm purchasing a plan. | **For example, when a user subscribes to a plan, their status is temporarily updated to `signing` pending subscription confirmation.** | "The users" should be "users" (incorrect article usage). "Transferred to the `idle` state" is incorrect; users actually transition to `signing` (see the [API Reference](../task2/index.md)). "Before they confirm purchasing" is awkward—"pending subscription confirmation" is smoother. | **For example, once you subscribe to a plan, your status will change to `signing` while we finalize everything.** | Conversational tone using "once you subscribe" and "we finalize everything" for clarity and engagement. |
| The capacity of plans per provider is unlimited, so feel free to create as many of them as necessary and customize them to up to a desirable extent. | **Providers can create an unlimited number of subscription plans, with each plan's availability governed by user type mappings. These plans can be customized to address specific business requirements.** | "The capacity of plans per provider is unlimited" is misleading; added explanation about user type mappings. "Feel free" is too informal for a partner-focused document. "Customize them to up to a desirable extent" is unclear and unnatural—simplified for clarity. | **If you're a provider, you can create as many subscription plans as you need. Each plan is set up for specific user types, and you can easily tweak them to suit your business needs.** | Uses "If you're a provider" for direct user engagement. "Easily tweak them" makes customization sound approachable and user-friendly. |
| Despite that, plans - merely surface well-known user attributes complying completely with the corresponding state flaw. | **Moreover, subscription plans are structured around standardized user attributes and enforced through role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure system security.** | "Despite that" is unclear in this context. "Plans - merely surface well-known user attributes" is awkward and vague; reworded for clarity. "Complying completely with the corresponding state flaw" is confusing—likely intended to refer to RBAC constraints. | **Plus, our subscription plans are built around familiar user profiles and protected by role-based access controls (RBAC) to keep things secure.** | Uses "Plus, our subscription plans" to sound more approachable. Keeps security emphasis while making it more user-friendly. |

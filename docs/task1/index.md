# System Architecture Documentation

## Introduction

At [CompanyName], we provide a multi-tenant system designed to serve multiple partners (providers) under a unified platform. Each partner maintains its own user base, with configurable user roles, permissions, and service plans tailored to their business needs.

Our architecture follows core multi-tenancy principles and incorporates robust subscription management. Partners can create and manage subscription plans with flexible parameters and user type mappings. Users benefit from an improved experience with additional profile attributes, such as subscription status, and a structured subscription lifecycle.

### Who Should Read This?

This document is intended for:

- **Backend Engineers** – To understand multi-tenancy, user roles, access control, and subscription workflows.  
- **Product Managers** – To see how features, including subscription options, can be enabled or restricted per partner.  
- **Support & Operations Teams** – To diagnose issues related to user permissions, subscription statuses, and feature availability.  
- **API Developers & Partners** – To integrate effectively with our partner-specific subscription APIs and understand the system architecture.  

### Common Challenges & Why This Document Matters

In a multi-tenant system, teams often encounter:

- **Role & Permission Ambiguity**  
  Variations in subscription plans and role assignments across partners can lead to confusion.  

- **Complex Access Control & Subscription Logic**  
  Understanding the nuances of partner isolation and subscription state transitions can make troubleshooting more challenging.  

- **Onboarding & Debugging Delays**  
  Without centralized documentation, new engineers and support teams struggle to understand system behavior and resolve issues efficiently.  

This document consolidates our architectural knowledge, covering user management, access control, session policies, and subscription management. It is designed to streamline onboarding, enhance cross-team communication, and accelerate problem resolution.

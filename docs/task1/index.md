# **System Architecture Documentation**

## Introduction
At [CompanyName], we power a system designed to serve multiple partners (providers) under a unified platform. Each partner maintains its own user base, and our architecture enables them to individually configure user roles, permissions, and service plans to meet their unique business requirements. In addition to core multi-tenant design principles, our solution incorporates robust subscription management capabilities. Partners can create and manage subscription plans—each with configurable parameters and user type mappings—while users benefit from an enhanced experience through additional profile attributes (such as subscription status) and a clearly defined subscription lifecycle.

### Who Should Read This?
This document is intended for:

- **Backend Engineers** → To understand multi-tenancy, user roles, access control, and the subscription management workflow.
- **Product Managers** → To gain clarity on how features (including subscription options) can be enabled or disabled per partner.
- **Support & Operations Teams** → To diagnose issues related to user permissions, subscription statuses, and feature availability.
- **API Developers & Partners** → To integrate effectively with our partner-specific subscription APIs and understand the underlying architecture.

### Common Challenges & Why This Document Matters

In our fast-paced multi-tenant environment, teams sometimes encounter:

- **Role & Permission Ambiguity:**  
  Variations in subscription plans and role assignments across partners can lead to confusion.

- **Complex Access Control and Subscription Logic:**  
  The nuances of partner isolation and subscription state transitions aren’t always clear, making troubleshooting more challenging.

- **Onboarding and Debugging Delays:**  
  Without centralized documentation, new engineers and support teams face delays in understanding system behavior and resolving issues.

This document consolidates our architecture knowledge—covering user management, access control, session policies, and subscription management—to streamline onboarding, enhance cross-team communication, and accelerate problem resolution.

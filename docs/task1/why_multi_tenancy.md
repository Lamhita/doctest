# **Understanding the Multi-Tenant Architecture**

## **The Need for Multi-Tenancy**

In a system where multiple partners (providers) manage their own users, **multi-tenancy** is the most efficient way to maintain **strict data separation** while ensuring **scalability, configurability, and security**. Instead of deploying separate infrastructures for each partner, multi-tenancy allows a **shared yet isolated** environment for all tenants.

Key reasons for adopting multi-tenancy in this system include:

---

### **1. Strict Partner Data & User Isolation**

To ensure full separation between partners and their users, the system:

- Keeps each partner’s users and data **completely isolated**.

- Implements **user segmentation** to prevent cross-partner authentication.

- Prevents **data leakage** across different partners.

- Enforces **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to apply **partner-specific access policies**.

- Ensures compliance with **security and data protection policies**.

- See: [User Management Model](./architecture/user_management.md).

---

### **2. Configurable User Roles & Feature Sets**

To support the flexibility of different partners, the system:

- Provides **multiple user roles**, including:

  - `guest`, `basic`, `advanced`, `company`, `admin`.

- Allows **dynamic role configurations** per partner.

- Enforces **RBAC policies** to manage **granular access permissions**.

- Supports **feature toggles** to let partners enable/disable **specific functionalities**.

- See: [User Roles and Transitions](./security/rbac.md).

---

### **3. Subscription & Service Management**

To ensure subscription services are adaptable to each partner's needs, the system:

- Supports **configurable subscription plans per partner**, ensuring:

  - **Plan availability restrictions** based on user roles.

  - **Subscription workflows** (`signing → confirmed → suspended`).

- Applies **multi-tenancy rules to subscription lifecycle management** without disrupting other tenants.

- See: [Subscription & Service Plan Control](./subscriptions/plan_restrictions.md).

---

### **4. Scalability Without Redundant Deployments**

To maintain high availability and scalability, the system:

- Allows **rapid onboarding** of new partners **without separate deployments**.

- Reduces **infrastructure duplication** by **leveraging shared resources**.

- Ensures **global system updates** without affecting **partner-specific configurations**.

---

### **5. Operational & Cost Efficiency**

To optimize infrastructure and operational management, the system:

- Reduces **infrastructure costs**, **manual overhead**, and **redundant resource allocation**.

- Centralizes **monitoring, updates, and maintenance**, reducing **administrative effort**.

- Implements **rate limiting & session control** per tenant to **prevent system abuse**.

  - See: [Session Management Policy](./sessions/session_management_policy.md).

---

### **6. Security, Authentication & Compliance**

To ensure strong security and regulatory compliance, the system:

- Enforces **data segmentation** across **database, application, and API layers**.

- Implements **session management rules** to **prevent cross-tenant access issues**.

- Uses **RBAC enforcement** to prevent unauthorized access across partners.

- Ensures compliance with **GDPR, SOC 2**, and other **security regulations** through **strict audit policies**.

- See: [Partner-Specific Isolation](./security/multi_tenancy.md).

## **Challenges of Multi-Tenancy**

While multi-tenancy offers **significant advantages**, it also introduces certain complexities:

| **Challenge** | **Solution** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Data & Access Control Complexity** | Ensuring **no cross-tenant data access** through **RBAC & data isolation policies**. |
| **User Role Transitions** | **Maintaining partner-specific role configurations** while enforcing **system-wide upgrade/downgrade rules**. |
| **Subscription & Session Limits Per Partner** | Ensuring **subscription eligibility & session management policies** remain consistent. |
| **Resource Allocation & Performance** | **Preventing a single partner from overloading shared infrastructure**. |
| **Feature Customization** | **Balancing partner-specific feature toggles** while **rolling out global updates**. |

These challenges are mitigated through:

- Strict RBAC policies

- Isolated data partitions  

- Scalable authentication & session handling strategies  

- Subscription-based access control policies

## **Conclusion**

Multi-tenancy allows the system to **efficiently serve multiple partners** while maintaining **data isolation, security, and scalability**. By leveraging **shared infrastructure with configurable user roles, authentication policies, subscription management, and access controls**, the system remains **cost-effective, customizable, and future-proof**.

# Understanding the Multi-Tenant Architecture

## The Need for Multi-Tenancy

In a system where multiple partners (providers) manage their own users, multi-tenancy is an efficient way to maintain strict data separation while ensuring scalability, configurability, and security. Instead of deploying separate infrastructures for each partner, multi-tenancy allows a shared yet isolated environment for all tenants.

Key reasons for adopting multi-tenancy in this system include:

---

## Strict Partner Data & User Isolation

To ensure full separation between partners and their users, the system:

- Keeps each partner’s users and data completely isolated.  
- Implements user segmentation to prevent cross-partner authentication.  
- Prevents data leakage across different partners.  
- Enforces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to apply partner-specific access policies.  
- Ensures compliance with security and data protection policies.  

See: [User Management Model](./architecture/user_management.md).

---

## Configurable User Roles & Feature Sets

To support the flexibility of different partners, the system:

- Provides multiple user roles (types), including:  

    - `guest`, `basic`, `advanced`, `company`, `admin`  

- Allows dynamic role configurations per partner.  
- Enforces RBAC policies to manage granular access permissions.  
- Supports feature toggles to let partners enable or disable specific functionalities.  

See: [User Roles and Transitions](./security/rbac.md).

---

## Subscription & Service Management

To ensure subscription services are adaptable to each partner's needs, the system:

- Supports configurable subscription plans per partner, ensuring:  

  - Plan availability restrictions based on user roles.  
  - Subscription workflows (`signing → signed → suspended → unsigned`).  

- Applies multi-tenancy rules to subscription lifecycle management without disrupting other tenants.  

See: [Subscription Management and Lifecycle](./subscription_management.md).

## Scalability Without Redundant Deployments

To maintain high availability and scalability, the system:

- Allows rapid onboarding of new partners without separate deployments.  
- Reduces infrastructure duplication by leveraging shared resources.  
- Ensures system updates without affecting partner-specific configurations.  

---

## Operational & Cost Efficiency

To optimize infrastructure and operational management, the system:

- Reduces infrastructure costs, manual overhead, and redundant resource allocation.  
- Centralizes monitoring, updates, and maintenance, reducing administrative effort.  
- Implements session control policies per tenant to prevent system abuse.  

See: [Session Management Policy](./sessions/session_management_overview.md).

---

## Security, Authentication & Compliance

To ensure strong security and regulatory compliance, the system:

- Enforces data segmentation across database, application, and API layers.  
- Implements session management rules to prevent cross-tenant access issues.  
- Uses RBAC enforcement to prevent unauthorized access across partners.
